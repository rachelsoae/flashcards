# FlashCards 

## Abstract
This is a flashcards study game, playable via the Command-Line Interface (CLI). Throughout the development process I utilized Test Driven Development (TDD) and implemented a Red Green Testing model, writing (and failing) unit tests prior to writing (and passing) implementation code for each feature.

This project was planned using a Notion Timeline ([link](https://www.notion.so/soaespace/Mod-2-Flashcards-Project-3ba7fb47dc0142cfb98e571a24027667?pvs=4)). To start planning the project, I previewed the provided `util.js` file and the requirements for `start()` to determine the big picture goals of the project and understand the relationships between the different iterations/phases. I mapped the individual steps onto my timeline with embedded checklists for each phase including pseuodocoding, writing tests, writing implementation code, and refactoring. As refactoring ideas arose, I added refactoring steps to the later parts of the timeline and also kept track of statuses and blockers for each phase.
